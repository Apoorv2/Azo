      question: 'How does the AI work?',
      answer:
        'Azo reaches potential customers for your business through targeted ads. The targeted ads are optimized on a range of parameters, including the clientâ€™s industry, user location, user behavior, user profile, ad schedule, etc. Our AI Platform then segregates the leads generated into hot, warm, and cold leads for the client, which helps in refining the go-to-customer strategy.',

    },
    {
      question: 'Why should I leave my current digital marketing agency and select Azo for lead generation?',
      answer:
        "Azo empowers you to independently generate high-quality leads, at 1/10th the price charged by a digital marketing agency. Also, our AI algorithm classifies all incoming leads into distinct categories: 'Hot,' 'Warm,' and 'Cold'. But that's not all. Our comprehensive approach involves initiating a sequence of automated messages on your behalf, effectively introducing your business and its offerings to every lead. This strategic process ensures that leads are well-acquainted with your brand even before your team reaches out for the initial conversation. This also helps in lead nurturing. For instance, if a lead is generated over the weekend and the first point of contact is scheduled for Monday, Azo bridges the gap by establishing a connection on the same weekend, thus priming the lead for a successful engagement. With Azo, your leads are not only generated but also cultivated, resulting in enhanced conversion rates and a seamless lead conversion experience.",
